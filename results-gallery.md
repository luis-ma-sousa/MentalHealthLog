This three-panel visualization combines key insights:

- **Top panel**: Heatmap showing mood patterns by hour of day, revealing when positive and negative feelings are most common.
- **Middle panel**: Sankey diagram illustrating the relationships between different emotions and activity choices (exercise and meditation).

These Sankey diagrams contrast activity patterns between daytime and nighttime hours:

- **Daytime (7 AM - 7 PM)**: Shows the relationship between emotions and activities during daylight hours. The flow lines visualize how different emotional states correlate with exercise and meditation choices.
- **Nighttime (7 PM - 7 AM)**: Reveals how the same relationships change during evening and night hours, with different emotional patterns and activity choices.

The visualization helps identify when certain emotions are more likely to trigger healthy activities and how these patterns shift throughout the day.

This multi-panel visualization reveals exercise patterns across different emotional states and contexts:

- **Top panel**: Shows the probability of exercising during different emotional states. Notably, exercise is most likely during calm states and least likely during anxiety/anger.
- **Middle panel**: Demonstrates how different contributing factors correlate with exercise likelihood. Birthday party, great news, and social events show the strongest positive associations.
- **Bottom left**: Maps exercise probability throughout the day, revealing peak exercise times at 8-9 AM, 4 PM, 8 PM, and 11 PM.
- **Bottom right**: Box plot comparing feeling intensity between exercise and non-exercise days, suggesting possible mood benefits from exercise.

# üìä Dashboard Results Gallery

This gallery showcases example visualizations generated by the MentalHealthLog Dashboard using anonymized mock data. These visualizations demonstrate the dashboard's capability to reveal patterns in emotional states, activities, and contributing factors.

This multi-panel visualization reveals exercise patterns across different emotional states and contexts:

- **Top panel**: Shows the probability of exercising during different emotional states. Notably, exercise is most likely during calm states and least likely during anxiety/anger.
- **Middle panel**: Demonstrates how different contributing factors correlate with exercise likelihood. Birthday party, great news, and social events show the strongest positive associations.
- **Bottom left**: Maps exercise probability throughout the day, revealing peak exercise times at 8-9 AM, 4 PM, 8 PM, and 11 PM.
- **Bottom right**: Box plot comparing feeling intensity between exercise and non-exercise days, suggesting possible mood benefits from exercise.

## üåì Day vs. Night Activity Patterns

![Day-Night Activity](./examples/day_night_activity.png)

These Sankey diagrams contrast activity patterns between daytime and nighttime hours:

- **Daytime (7 AM - 7 PM)**: Shows the relationship between emotions and activities during daylight hours. The flow lines visualize how different emotional states correlate with exercise and meditation choices.
- **Nighttime (7 PM - 7 AM)**: Reveals how the same relationships change during evening and night hours, with different emotional patterns and activity choices.

The visualization helps identify when certain emotions are more likely to trigger healthy activities and how these patterns shift throughout the day.

## üìà Mood and Activity Relationships

This three-panel visualization combines key insights:

- **Top panel**: Heatmap showing mood patterns by hour of day, revealing when positive and negative feelings are most common.
- **Middle panel**: Sankey diagram illustrating the relationships between different emotions and activity choices (exercise and meditation).
- **Bottom panel**: Sunburst chart breaking down contributing factors that influence emotional states, with each wedge representing different life events or situations.

Together, these visualizations help identify potential triggers and effective coping mechanisms.

## üìä General Overview Dashboard

![Overview Dashboard](./examples/overview_dashboard.png)

- **Top row**: Pie charts showing the distribution of emotions and feeling intensities, with the largest segments indicating the most common states.
- **Middle**: Timeline tracking mood fluctuations over a month, revealing patterns, trends, and potential triggering periods.
- **Bottom**: Bar charts comparing exercise and meditation frequencies, showing the balance between days with and without these activities.

This dashboard provides a quick snapshot of overall emotional wellness and activity patterns.

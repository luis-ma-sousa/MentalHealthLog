## 🚀 Setup and Usage

### 📋 Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: pandas, plotly, numpy, imaplib (for email functionality)

### 💻 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luis-ma-sousa/MentalHealthLog.git
   cd MentalHealthLog/Notebook
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas plotly numpy openpyxl jupyter
   ```

### ⚙️ Configuration
For email functionality, update the credentials in the email retrieval section of the notebook:
```python
EMAIL = "your_email@example.com"
PASSWORD = "your_password"
IMAP_SERVER = "imap.example.com"
```

For security, it's recommended to use environment variables or a secure configuration file rather than hardcoding credentials.

### 📄 Data Structure
The dashboard expects CSV files with at least the following columns:
- `DateTime`: The date and time of the log entry
- `Feeling`: The intensity of the feeling (Very Unpleasant, Unpleasant, Slightly Unpleasant, Neutral, Pleasant, Very Pleasant)
- `Emotion`: The specific emotion experienced (Joy, Love, Calm, Hope, Contentment, Surprise, Nostalgia, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Drained, Anxiety, Frustration)
- `Exercise`: Whether exercise was performed (yes/no)
- `Meditation`: Whether meditation was practiced (yes/no)
- `Contributing Factors`: Comma-separated list of factors that influenced the emotional state
- `Thoughts`: Additional notes or thoughts about the entry

### 🏃‍♂️ Running the Dashboard
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the `MentalHealthLog Dashboard.ipynb` file

3. Execute the notebook cells sequentially:
   - If using email retrieval, the system will fetch new entries automatically
   - Otherwise, place your CSV files in the designated folder
   - The notebook will generate all visualizations and insights

## 🔎 Interpreting Results

### 💪 Activity Impact
The dashboard helps identify how activities like exercise and meditation correlate with emotional states. Look for:
- Differences in mood scores between days with and without certain activities
- Emotional states more likely to lead to exercise or meditation
- Time periods when activities have the greatest positive impact

### 😊 Emotional Patterns
Identify recurring patterns in your emotional wellbeing:
- Times of day when you typically feel best/worst
- Contributing factors most associated with positive or negative emotions
- Day vs. night emotional differences

## 📷 Example Visualizations

For sample visualizations and analysis examples, see the [results gallery](../results-gallery.md) in the main project directory.

## 🔄 Integration with Web App

This dashboard is designed to work with the data collected by the [MentalHealthLog Web App](../App/README.md). For information on how to set up the complete system, refer to the [main project README](../README.md).

## 🔒 Data Privacy & Security

This dashboard processes personal health information. Consider these security measures:
- Never share notebooks with credentials
- Store raw data files securely
- Consider encrypting sensitive data

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Automated insights generation
- Predictive analysis of mood patterns
- Mobile-friendly dashboard version
- Interactive filtering capabilities
- Export reports as PDF
